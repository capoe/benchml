BenchML
*******

BenchML is a library for rapid development, benchmarking and testing of machine-learning models for materials and drug discovery.
BenchML provides a wide variety of data transforms, incorporating various descriptors, regressors, matrix transforms etc. The library is based on a simple yet powerful node-based pipelining approach. Efficient execution and validation is achieved through automatic precomputation of "immutable" data. Hyper-optimization is provided via both grid-based and Bayesian optimization.

Pipelining concept
==================

BenchML modules consist of a series of interdependent transforms, each of which acts on a data stream in a specific way (see schematic below). The data stream stores "sliceable" data (such as lists or matrices) in the sense that they can be easily split into child streams, as required for model cross-validation, and nested hyperparameter optimization.
